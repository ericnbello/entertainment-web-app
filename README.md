# Entertainment web app solution

While this is a solution to the [Entertainment web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/entertainment-web-app-J-UhgAW1X) challenge and Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects, I decided to add extra functionality to create a full stack web application using Firebase.
